### 🌐 3. Basic Networking

#### IP Addressing & Subnetting
- IPv4 format, subnet masks, CIDR notation
- Private vs Public IP ranges
- Calculating usable hosts per subnet

#### Networking Models
- OSI & TCP/IP models
- Layer responsibilities

> 🧩 **Use case**: Designing efficient local networks and troubleshooting IP conflicts.

### 🔗 4. Network Protocols

| Protocol | Purpose           |
|---------:|------------------|
| HTTP/S   | Web communication |
| SSH      | Secure remote access |
| FTP      | File transfer     |
| DNS      | Domain resolution |

> 🛡️ **Security tip**: Use SSH over Telnet. Prefer HTTPS to HTTP.

### ☁️ 5. Cloud Computing Intro

- **IaaS** – Infrastructure as a Service (e.g., AWS EC2)
- **PaaS** – Platform as a Service (e.g., Heroku)
- **SaaS** – Software as a Service (e.g., Google Workspace)

> ☁️ **Impact**: Cloud fluency is non-negotiable for scalable, cost-effective IT solutions.

## 🛠️ Hands-On Activities

### 1️⃣ Instructor Demo: Build a Virtual Lab

**Tools**: VirtualBox 
**Objective**: Set up a sandboxed environment for experimenting with different OSes and network configs.

**Tasks**:
- Install a Linux distro and Windows VM
- Configure network adapters (NAT, Bridged, Host-Only)
- Test inter-VM connectivity

---

### 2️⃣ Student Assignment: Configure a Home Network

**Objective**: Apply networking concepts to a real-life scenario.

**Requirements**:
- Assign static IPs to multiple devices
- Set up a basic firewall or security rules on router
- Document IP plan and security configurations

> ✅ Deliverable: Screenshot evidence + config summary in `assignments/home_network.md`
