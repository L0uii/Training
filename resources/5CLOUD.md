## ☁️ Cloud Computing Models

Cloud computing delivers IT resources on-demand via the internet. It eliminates the need to own and maintain physical infrastructure.

There are three main service models:

---

### 🔧 **IaaS – Infrastructure as a Service**

> *You rent the infrastructure – virtual machines, storage, networks.*

* You manage: OS, apps, middleware, runtime.
* Provider manages: virtualization, hardware, network.

#### 🔹 Examples:

* **Amazon EC2**
* **Microsoft Azure VMs**
* **Google Compute Engine**

#### 🔸 Use Cases:

* Host custom applications.
* Full control over OS and environment.
* Scalable test/dev environments.

---

### 🧱 **PaaS – Platform as a Service**

> *You focus on your code. The platform handles the rest.*

* You manage: application and data.
* Provider manages: runtime, OS, servers, scaling.

#### 🔹 Examples:

* **Heroku**
* **Google App Engine**
* **Azure App Service**

#### 🔸 Use Cases:

* Rapid application deployment.
* Avoid dealing with OS, patches, updates.
* Great for developers who want to push code and go.

---

### 🧑‍💻 **SaaS – Software as a Service**

> *You just use the software. Everything else is abstracted.*

* Fully managed by provider.
* Delivered via web browser or thin client.

#### 🔹 Examples:

* **Gmail / Google Workspace**
* **Microsoft 365**
* **Dropbox**

#### 🔸 Use Cases:

* Email, productivity suites, CRM, collaboration tools.
* Zero infrastructure or maintenance burden on the user.

### 🔁 Quick Comparison Table

| Feature     | IaaS           | PaaS            | SaaS     |
| ----------- | -------------- | --------------- | -------- |
| Control     | Full (OS & up) | App & data only | None     |
| Flexibility | High           | Medium          | Low      |
| Maintenance | You            | Shared          | Provider |
| Example     | AWS EC2        | Heroku          | Gmail    |
