## 🖥️ Computer Hardware Components

![alt text](/slides/computer_comp.jpg)

Modern computer systems consist of several fundamental hardware components. Here's a breakdown of each:

### **1. CPU (Central Processing Unit)**

* The "brain" of the computer.
* Executes instructions and processes data.
* Common architectures: x86 (Intel, AMD), ARM (mobile devices, servers).
* Clock speed (GHz) and core/thread count determine performance.

### **2. RAM (Random Access Memory)**

* Temporary working memory for active processes.
* Volatile – data is lost when powered off.
* More RAM = better multitasking and performance.
* Typical sizes: 8GB (basic), 16GB+ (development, VMs, heavy tasks).

### **3. Storage Devices**

* **HDD (Hard Disk Drive)**: Magnetic, slower, cheaper, high capacity (1TB+).
* **SSD (Solid State Drive)**: Flash-based, faster, more expensive, better for OS and apps.
* **NVMe SSDs**: Much faster than SATA SSDs. Plug directly into PCIe lanes.

### **4. Motherboard**

* Main circuit board connecting all components.
* Contains:

  * CPU socket
  * RAM slots (DIMMs)
  * Expansion slots (PCIe)
  * Storage interfaces (SATA, M.2)
  * I/O ports and firmware (BIOS/UEFI)

### **5. PSU (Power Supply Unit)**

* Converts AC power to regulated DC voltages.
* Wattage depends on hardware needs (typically 400W–1000W).

### **6. GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)**

* Handles rendering of images, video, and 3D graphics.
* **Integrated GPUs**: Built into CPU, lower performance.
* **Discrete GPUs**: Dedicated cards (NVIDIA, AMD), used for gaming, ML, video editing.

### **7. NIC (Network Interface Card)**

* Enables wired or wireless network connectivity.
* Can be onboard or a separate PCIe card.
* 10/100/1000 Mbps or higher (1G/10G Ethernet, Wi-Fi 6).

### **8. Peripherals**

* **Input**: Keyboard, mouse, touchscreen.
* **Output**: Monitors, printers, speakers.
* **I/O Ports**: USB (2.0/3.0/Type-C), HDMI, DisplayPort, Ethernet.
